// Create a dynamic route of this /search/:username(which is currently a problem to face)

Create feature where the searched user when found,we click on the user's followers and following and get more data
For this we need to create a new array then do some shit on that,we cant mutate the userProfileObject since the user is still the same,the person we are searching is different 


Then create the follow unfollow button logic when we find the user either by search or in the follow unfollow list

Create  route where user reaches to the profile when he clicks on the profile present in list of profiles among follow unfollow list
